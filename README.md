### Technology Stack

### Notes

* Duplicate commits and branches were caused by [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) when removing database credentials from the repo history. *Note to self: Don't play around with git repo history and just rotate the credentials/passwords in the future...*
